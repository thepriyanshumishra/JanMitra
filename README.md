> **"Portals collect complaints. JAN-MITRA resolves them."**

**Jan-Mitra** (People's Friend) is a next-generation civic grievance redressal platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and administration. It leverages **Browser-Side AI** for instant prioritization and **Blockchain Simulation** for immutable accountability.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 The Intelligence Layer (AI)
Unlike traditional portals that are just "digital mailboxes," Jan-Mitra understands the problem before a human ever sees it.
-   **Auto-Categorization**: Instantly tags issues (e.g., "Sanitation", "Infrastructure").
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects citizen frustration levels to gauge urgency.
-   **Priority Scoring**: Uses NLP to flag critical keywords (e.g., "flooding", "sparking wire").

### ⛓️ The Accountability Layer (Blockchain)
Trust is built on transparency.
-   **Immutable Ledger**: Every status change is hashed and "stored" on the Polygon network.
-   **Smart SLA**: Auto-escalation timers ensure no grievance is ignored.
-   **Public Audit**: Citizens can verify the journey of their complaint.

### 💎 The Experience Layer (GlassOS)
Government software shouldn't look like it's from 1995.
-   **Glassmorphism UI**: A modern, frosted-glass aesthetic.
-   **Command Center**: A Bento-grid dashboard for high-density information.
-   **Zero Latency**: Optimistic UI updates for a snappy feel.
